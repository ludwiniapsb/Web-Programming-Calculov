Curious and energetic, Sagittarius is one of the biggest travelers among all zodiac signs. Their open mind and philosophical view motivates them to wander around the world in search of the meaning of life.

Sagittarius is extrovert, optimistic and enthusiastic, and likes changes. Sagittarius-born are able to transform their thoughts into concrete actions and they will do anything to achieve their goals.

Like the other fire signs, Sagittarius needs to be constantly in touch with the world to experience as much as possible. The ruling planet of Sagittarius is Jupiter, the largest planet of the zodiac. Their enthusiasm has no bounds, and therefore people born under the Sagittarius sign possess a great sense of humor and an intense curiosity.

Freedom is their greatest treasure, because only then they can freely travel and explore different cultures and philosophies. Because of their honesty, Sagittarius-born are often impatient and tactless when they need to say or do something, so it's important to learn to express themselves in a tolerant and socially acceptable way.

Goofy, sweet Sagittarius provides levity to serious Virgo. Sagittarius' strong sense of direction makes sure that they value Virgo's attitude and commitment to work, as when Sagittarius is completely tuned into a project, they share a lot of Virgo's ethic.

Both of these signs feel a strong need to rationalize and analyze. They make their decisions based on intellect, rather than going with their gut. Emotionally, this couple will work completely in sync and will usually be in agreement about major life choices. If they aren't, their divergent paths will usually pull them apart.
