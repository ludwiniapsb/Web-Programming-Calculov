Pisces are very friendly, so they often find themselves in a company of very different people. Pisces are selfless, they are always willing to help others, without hoping to get anything back.

Pisces is a Water sign and as such this zodiac sign is characterized by empathy and expressed emotional capacity.

Their ruling planet is Neptune, so Pisces are more intuitive than others and have an artistic talent. Neptune is connected to music, so Pisces reveal music preferences in the earliest stages of life. They are generous, compassionate and extremely faithful and caring.

People born under the Pisces sign have an intuitive understanding of the life cycle and thus achieve the best emotional relationship with other beings.

Pisces-born are known by their wisdom, but under the influence of Uranus, Pisces sometimes can take the role of a martyr, in order to catch the attention. Pisces are never judgmental and always forgiving. They are also known to be most tolerant of all the zodiac signs.

Pisces are the most emotional of all the signs. Extremely intuitive and sensitive, they seek romantic love and need a soulmate more than most. This can be very beautiful for the partner of a Pisces, as their deep love and empathy makes for a very spiritual bond. A union with a Pisces automatically makes their partner feel special and cherished solely because Pisces are so emotive and intuitive.
Pisces sometimes need a more direct partner to get the ball rolling. Their shyness can impede the start of a relationship or prolong the initial process, so bear in mind that you may have to open up first and gently nudge your Pisces in the direction of romance. Tread carefully with this special sign and in return you will reap the benefits in your romance. Pisces is a water sign and can sometimes be deemed 'flighty'. This is only because of their hesitation to open themselves up, since they instinctively realize that once they open up, their heart is pretty much handed over to their lover.
Being loved by a Pisces is ethereal and soft. This sign is highly emotive and sensitive and tends to be very selfless. They often put their partners needs above their own. This may become dangerous if the match isn't healthy, as Pisces selflessness can leave them vulnerable to hurt and manipulation. If you love a Pisces, be very gentle and very honest and tactful with them. This sign gives the utmost in loyalty and devotion and their sensitivities should be honored and cherished. Pisces selflessness makes them excellent partners and parents. They love family and tradition and will excel in both arenas.
