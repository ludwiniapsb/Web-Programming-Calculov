<p> Taurus is an earth sign represented by the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal, Taureans enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic environments, surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and succulent flavors. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the enchanting planet that governs love, beauty, and money. Taurus’s Venusian influence make this earth sign the most sensual of the zodiac: These cosmic oxen are enchanted by any physical manifestation of comfort and luxury. Pleasure is a necessity for epicurean Taureans and they feel most content when pampered. (Taurus governs the neck, so neck caresses are especially irresistible to these bulls.)

It's true that in their perfect world, Taureans would spend all day bathing in a tub overflowing with essential oils. At the same time, these earth signs know the value of a dollar. Taureans aren’t afraid to roll up their sleeves and work hard to earn big rewards. They're ambitious, focused, and resilient and they feel most secure when steadily putting money into a savings account.</p>

Romance, sensual touch and intimacy are things we crave, and when we don’t have it, we always go looking for it. The problem is, Taurus traits include stubbornness, meaning Taurus will rarely admit they are wrong.


On the other hand, the Taurus sign makes for one of the most loyal, loving partners out of all the zodiac signs in astrology. You won’t find anyone more devoted to a relationship than Taurus. Whether it’s cooking you dinner, buying you a new shirt or planning a romantic night in, Taurus is always thinking of you above everything.


RELATED: The Person Each Zodiac Sign Wishes They Were Compatible With (But Aren't)

For Taurus women, especially, you may need to break through a hard exterior to really get her to tell you how she feels, and there will be times where she will probably make a small change the most complicated situation in the world. She may be the most hard-headed girl you’ll ever meet, but she’s so worth it.


Taurus is most commonly compatible with Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and Pisces.

Taurus' well-rounded personality makes her easy to love and compatible with a lot of different people. You love the romantic and sensitive signs because they know exactly what to do to give you the attention you need.

That's great and all, but not everyone is compatible.

Leo and Aquarius are pretty much the opposite of everything Taurus wants and needs. Aquarius and Leo are adventurous, spontaneous, and play by their own rules, which doesn't match Taurus' structured and routine lifestyle.


Taurus loves a good adventure every once in a while, but too many sudden changes will not work for her. And even though you may or may not be compatible in the romantic department, sexual compatibility is a whole other beast.

Taurus and Sagittarius are sexually compatible, but romantically they have nothing in common. Taurus brings the sensual side and Sagittarius brings the fun side to the bedroom.

Although your intimate life is well-rounded, your communication skills are pretty much down the toilet. Your ways of thinking are completely opposite, so maybe stick to friends with benefits.
