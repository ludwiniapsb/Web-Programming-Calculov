					<h1>Leo (♌︎)</h1>

<p> Roll out the red carpet, because Leo has arrived. Leo is represented by the lion, and these spirited fire signs are the kings and queens of the celestial jungle. They’re delighted to embrace their royal status: Vivacious, theatrical, and passionate, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate themselves. These lions are natural leaders and they enjoy cultivating friendships and romances that are artistically and creatively inspired. Playful Leos have no problem leaning into drama-fueled romances that are perfectly suited for the tabloids. (In fact, they may even prefer them.) After all, every Leo perceives him or herself as a celebrity. These astrological divas never get tired of lavish dinners, exclusive parties, or decadent designer wear.</p>

Leos love being coddled and having their egos stroked, so flirtatious, romantic Libra is a great match! This couple is always being invited to parties because they’re sooo much fun to be around. Both signs love attention and truly want the best for everyone. They can def learn a lot from each other and will likely have a very balanced relationship.

Kingly Leo is attracted to someone who’s just as vibrant and unique as they are, so Aries is a wonderful match too. Both are full of passion and intensity that will, together, make sparks fly. They’re both bold and brash, and their fire sign compatibility is out of this world! Plus, there is a sexual chemistry that seems to just get better and better with age.

Fellow fire sign Sagittarius has a spontaneous, adventurous spirit that Leo finds super attractive. These two firebrands throw the best parties, go on the most luxurious vacations, and basically glow with charisma. Talk about a power couple!
