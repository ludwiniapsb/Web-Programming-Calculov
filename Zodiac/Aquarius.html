The water carrier represented by the zodiacal constellation Aquarius is Ganymede, a beautiful Phrygian youth. Ganymede was the son of Tros, king of Troy (according to Lucian, he was also the son of Dardanus). While tending to his father's flocks on Mount Ida, Ganymede was spotted by Zeus. The king of gods fell in love with him and flew down to the mountain in the form of a large bird, whisking Ganymede away to the heavens. Ever since, the boy has served as cupbearer to the gods. Ovid has Orpheus sing the tale.

When you're in a relationship with an Aquarius, you better believe there is a true friendship beneath the romance. Because Aquarians don't rely on their emotions as much as other signs, the way they know if they want to explore a relationship further is if there is a natural, friendly vibe between the two of you. And bonus: Because Aquarians are all about friendship, they make great companions for social butterflies who enjoy hanging out in group settings.

A relationship with an Aquarius will never be one of those experiences where there's tons of passion, but you don't really connect on a mental level. Aquarians NEED a mental connection with their romantic partners. They are intellectual and logical by nature and need a partner they feel comfortable conversing and sharing their ideas with.

And because Aquarians value their individuality so strongly, they are just as respectful of the individuality of others. You'll never feel like your Aquarius partner is being controlling or possessive -- part of the way they show love is by allowing you the space to be yourself.
