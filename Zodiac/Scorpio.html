Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Because of its incredible passion and power, Scorpio is often mistaken for a fire sign. In fact, Scorpio is a water sign that derives its strength from the psychic, emotional realm. Like fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces, Scorpio is extremely clairvoyant and intuitive.

What makes this water sign unique is its distinctive venomous sting. Like their celestial spirit animal, the scorpion, Scorpios lie in wait and strike when least expected. Life is a game of chess for these calculating water signs, who are constantly plotting several steps ahead in order to orchestrate an eventual checkmate. This doesn't mean their intentions are necessarily nefarious. Scorpios simply know what they want and aren't afraid to work hard and play the long game to get it.

Virgo and Scorpio actually share a mutual dark side: Virgo's nit-picky attitude is reflected in Scorpio's watery depths. Where Virgo will wield this trait against others, Scorpio will internalize it against themselves. Scorpio's self-criticism will lead to anger or depression.

A Virgo-Scorpio relationship will feel karmic, as it provides both signs with the opportunity to investigate the sources of their flaws and work to heal their wounds. This might sound frightening to other signs, but Scorpio has never shied away from the dark. This is a couple who will evolve together. They might not be together forever, but what they learn from one another will last for the rest of their lives.
