<p> Cancer is a cardinal water sign. Represented by the crab, this oceanic crustacean seamlessly weaves between the sea and shore, representing Cancer’s ability to exist in both emotional and material realms. Cancers are highly intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces: For instance, Cancers can effortlessly pick up the energies in a room. These crabs are highly sensitive to their environments, as well as extremely self-protective. Much like their celestial spirit animal, Cancers are shielded by hard, external shells. At first, these crabs may be perceived as cold or distant. With time, though, Cancers reveal their gentle nature, genuine compassion, and mystical capabilities. Just don't be surprised if it takes a while to get to know them.

Cancerians will be expecting a massive shift in their lives which will be quite significant for their relationships with others. The year 2021 will be the year where you will regain fruitful relationships, look for intellectual satisfaction so that you can achieve your goals and ambitions. This year, Cancerians will especially focus on their families and relationships, all the while maintaining a line amidst everything i.e boundaries.
Coming to relationships as a whole, many Cancerians are likely to get into short term relationships because they want to be in the moment. The past year has been harsh on them and they have faced failures in their life and relationships as well. This time, they want to give their all to the other person (since this is one of their main qualities) and be in the moment. Those who are looking to be in committed relationships will be conversing a lot with their potential partner. Texts, messages, calls, video calls are all on the cards for Cancerians as they will heavily rely on social media and forms of communication for talking to their interested date. Communication will be a major point in Cancerians’ relationships.

Those people who are already married to their beloved partner will face circumstances that will showcase their love and support for each other in difficult times. These circumstances will stand as the pillar through which these married couples will realise their love for each other, a lot more. As the saying goes, ‘difficult times prove who will stay with you the most’ is true for Cancerians.
However, single Cancerians have to be careful about blurting too much information about themselves in front of other people. They tend to speak a lot about their loved ones and their relationships, that a third person can potentially threaten. They can run your relationship down. You have to be careful about disclosing the details of your personal life to other people. Other than this, single Cancerians also have to let others know, that they are ready to mingle and date. They have to take the initiative of talking to potentially interested people, who they might have a chance to date. It is all about believing oneself, and if they do, Cancerians might just have the best year!
l-rounded, your communication skills are pretty much down the toilet. Your ways of thinking are completely opposite, so maybe stick to friends with benefits.
