<p> Gemini sign is all about this kind of mental stimulation (makes sense, considering it's ruled by Mercury, which governs the mind). They're into conversation, being expressive, being spontaneous, and challenging themselves. At home, they're the first to volunteer for game nights and love ending the evening with deep talks about anything and everything. When they're out and about, you can count on them to make a new friend in minutes, and bring you in on a debate they just started up out of nowhere.</p>

<p> Geminis love to give all the power to their partner because they love a bit of domination in their physical and emotional relationships. But, this is when Geminis have to be a bit careful about giving themselves into their partner completely, way ahead of time. Even if Geminis feel that they have met their soulmate, they should hold off a little bit from giving all the power to their partner. They might feel overwhelmed with their partner’s presence which will lead them to give in to their partner easily. In this situation, Geminis will have to keep a strict balance between their individualities and power, so that they don’t feel bored with the relationship easily.
Committed Geminis shouldn't come across as controlling or overly dominant people in their relationships as these can be a huge problem, especially for their partners. They might feel insecure and confused by Gemini's actions. Additionally, they should also be conscious of a third person entering their lives and creating trust issues and tensions from within. If they are able to take care of these two major problems, then Geminis will be able to enjoy the upcoming year with much cheer and joy in their love life, with their partner.</p>
