<p> The name Aries is Latin for ram, and its symbol is, representing a ram's horns. It is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is a mid-sized constellation, ranking 39th overall size, with an area of 441 square degrees. Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, the stars of Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal, Sheratan, Mesartim, and 41 Arietis. The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.</p>

<p>Aries is a direct and forthright lover. They don't generally play mind games, and you will typically know exactly where you stand when in a relationship with an Aries. They can sometimes be relatively aggressive and domineering partners, but it's done in a genuine, enthusiastic and bold manner which is hard to find fault with. Overall the excitement of dating an Aries overrides their take charge attitude. Along these lines they are often the initiator of a relationship, and the most common complaint is that they can come on too strong or try to move things along too fast.

Whether male or female it's worth noting that Aries don't want weak partners. Just because they tend towards being dominating it doesn't mean they don't want to work for it! Quite the opposite, they often get bored rapidly with a partner who is a pushover. They typically do best with an equally feisty and confident lover.

Aries is one of the most physically protective signs of the Zodiac, typically not hesitating to risk life or limb if a loved one is in danger. The flip side to this is that they rarely will back down from a fight or challenge, no matter how bad the odds may initially appear. Courageous and full of integrity, it's hard not to admire them in this area.<p>
